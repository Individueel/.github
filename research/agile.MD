## What is agile development?
Agile development is a project management approach that emphasizes frequent delivery of working software in small increments. Unlike traditional "all-at-once" approaches, Agile allows teams to provide regular updates and involve the customer throughout the development process. Agile teams review requirements, plans, and deliverables at each iteration, enabling them to adapt to changes effectively.

## Comparison with Traditional Methods
In the past, waterfall was commonly used for software development, but it had various shortcomings such as lack of communication within teams and the potential for projects to take years without delivering a working product. Agile methods address these issues by promoting frequent communication through meetings and breaking work into iterations, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and incrementally adding features over time. (Cohn, 2009; Fowler & Highsmith, 2001).

## Which methods are most popular?
There are several popular agile methods that have evolved over time. The most well-known ones include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP.

- Scrum: Scrum is a framework within the Agile approach that involves dividing a project into smaller sprints of about 1 to 4 weeks. The team, consisting of 3 to 9 people, focuses on delivering software and prioritizes tasks in collaboration with the product owner. (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2017; Kniberg, 2007)

- Lean: Lean originated in industrial manufacturing and was later applied to software development as Lean software development. It emphasizes reducing wasted time by continuously improving the development process. (Poppendieck & Poppendieck, 2003)

- Kanban: Kanban is an adaptation of Lean development and was further developed by David Anderson. It utilizes visual or physical boards, similar to tools like Trello, to represent work in progress and identify and resolve bottlenecks in the workflow. (Anderson, 2010)

According to a survey conducted in 2020, Scrum is the most widely used agile method, followed by Kanban and Lean. (O'Loughlin, 2020)


## What are the difference between Scrum and other methods?
Scrum, Lean, and Kanban differ in their approaches and focus:

- Scrum: Scrum is a framework that emphasizes iterative development through regular feedback loops. It involves planning, testing, and reflecting with the customer multiple times during the project, which helps guide the team in the right direction. (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2017)

- Lean: Lean is more of a mindset than a specific framework. It provides guiding principles for reducing wasted time and continuously improving the development process. (Poppendieck & Poppendieck, 2003)

- Kanban: Kanban focuses on visualizing work and limiting the number of ongoing processes simultaneously. It aims to accelerate project completion through a kanban board and continuous workflow improvement. (Anderson, 2010)

## Choosing an Agile Management Tool

When selecting an agile management tool, several factors need to be considered:

- Compatibility with Scrum principles: As students, it is essential to find a tool that aligns with the principles of Scrum. For example, it should allow for iterative development and frequent feedback loops with the customer.
- Compatibility with Scrum principles: As students, it is essential to find a tool that aligns with Scrum principles, allowing you to effectively manage and track your projects. (Atlassian, 2022)
- Free for students: Finding a tool that is free for students can help you stay within budget while still benefiting from agile management features.
- Acceptance by professionals: It is important to choose a tool that is widely accepted and used by professionals in software development, as this indicates its reliability and suitability for real-world projects. (Capterra, 2022)
