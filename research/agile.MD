## What is agile development?
Agile development is a project management approach that emphasizes frequent delivery of working software in small increments. Unlike traditional "all-at-once" approaches, Agile allows teams to provide regular updates and involve the customer throughout the development process. Agile teams review requirements, plans, and deliverables at each iteration, enabling them to adapt to changes effectively.

## Comparison with Traditional Methods
In the past, waterfall was commonly used for software development, but it had various shortcomings such as lack of communication within teams and the potential for projects to take years without delivering a working product. Agile methods address these issues by promoting frequent communication through meetings and breaking work into iterations, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and incrementally adding features over time. (Cohn, 2009; Fowler & Highsmith, 2001).

## Which methods are most popular?
There are several popular agile methods that have evolved over time. The most well-known ones include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP.

- Scrum: Scrum is a framework within the Agile approach that involves dividing a project into smaller sprints of about 1 to 4 weeks. The team, consisting of 3 to 9 people, focuses on delivering software and prioritizes tasks in collaboration with the product owner. (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2017; Kniberg, 2007)

- Lean: Lean originated in industrial manufacturing and was later applied to software development as Lean software development. It emphasizes reducing wasted time by continuously improving the development process. (Poppendieck & Poppendieck, 2003)

- Kanban: Kanban is an adaptation of Lean development and was further developed by David Anderson. It utilizes visual or physical boards, similar to tools like Trello, to represent work in progress and identify and resolve bottlenecks in the workflow. (Anderson, 2010)

According to a survey conducted in 2020, Scrum is the most widely used agile method, followed by Kanban and Lean. (O'Loughlin, 2020)

## What is Lean
Lean prioritizes the elimination of waste to improve efficiency. This helps teams continually improve their processes while emphasizing the tasks that bring the most value to customers. (https://www.easyagile.com/blog/lean-agile/) 
Lean is a mindset that focuses on reducing waste and continuously improving the development process. It originated in industrial manufacturing and was later applied to software development as Lean software development. (Poppendieck & Poppendieck, 2003)

- Principles of Lean
1. Identify Value: The first step in Lean principles is to understand the customer's perspective. Value refers to what the customer needs and desires from a specific project or product. [Source: Lean Enterprise Institute]

2. Value Stream: The team visually maps out the steps and processes involved in bringing the product from inception to delivery. By making each step visible and keeping the value in mind, it becomes easier to identify steps that do not contribute directly to continuous delivery. The team then works to eliminate or reduce these wasteful steps. [Source: Lean Enterprise Institute]

3. Flow: Once waste is eliminated from the value stream, the focus shifts to ensuring that the remaining processes work effectively and efficiently. This involves minimizing delays, disruptions, and bottlenecks. Steps that create value should work in tight sequences to enable smooth product flow towards the customer. [Source: Lean Enterprise Institute]

4. Pull: Achieving enhanced flow allows the team to deliver products and services faster. Implementing a pull system enables "just-in-time" manufacturing and delivery, where production is limited to meet customer demand, reducing inventory and work in progress (WIP) items. [Source: Lean Enterprise Institute]

5. Perfection: The Lean journey does not end with waste elimination. Seeking perfection is an ongoing process. There will always be room for improvement, and certain steps in project and product development may still waste time, money, or fail to deliver value. Continually striving for perfection ensures a culture of continuous improvement. [Source: Lean Enterprise Institute]

## What are the difference between Scrum and other methods?
Scrum, Lean, and Kanban differ in their approaches and focus:

- Scrum: Scrum is a framework that emphasizes iterative development through regular feedback loops. It involves planning, testing, and reflecting with the customer multiple times during the project, which helps guide the team in the right direction. (Sutherland & Schwaber, 2017)

- Lean: Lean is more of a mindset than a specific framework. It provides guiding principles for reducing wasted time and continuously improving the development process. (Poppendieck & Poppendieck, 2003)

- Kanban: Kanban focuses on visualizing work and limiting the number of ongoing processes simultaneously. It aims to accelerate project completion through a kanban board and continuous workflow improvement. (Anderson, 2010)

## Choosing an Agile Management Tool

When selecting an agile management tool, several factors need to be considered:

- Compatibility with Scrum principles: As students, it is essential to find a tool that aligns with the principles of Scrum. For example, it should allow for iterative development and frequent feedback loops with the customer.
- Compatibility with Scrum principles: As students, it is essential to find a tool that aligns with Scrum principles, allowing you to effectively manage and track your projects. (Atlassian, 2022)
- Free for students: Finding a tool that is free for students can help you stay within budget while still benefiting from agile management features.
- Acceptance by professionals: It is important to choose a tool that is widely accepted and used by professionals in software development, as this indicates its reliability and suitability for real-world projects. (Capterra, 2022)
